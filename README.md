Gin-Rummy

This program is intended to allow two players to play a game of gin rummy
Rules for Rummy:
 -Need three pairs of 3 and one pair of four straight numbers with the
same suit (i.e. 3, 4, and 5 of spades is a pair of three)
-Every turn, have two options: Pick up bottom card or pick card from deck
-After picking up card, remove a card from current hande
-Repeat until someone can "show" aka they have all the sequences necessary
-Cards for each person is stored in a separate text file, and the picked up
card is also stored in a separate text file, so no cheating!
